# Welcome to PlantIt!

PlantIt is an open-source garden index for gardeners to keep track of plants they are growing in their garden. Users can create an account and save plants from the plant index to their own garden. If the plant does not exist in the index, the user can add it themselves, so that our garden keeps growing.

## Purpose

PlantIt was originally created with a team of developers from my Eleven Fifty Academy course. We were given a week to complete this project and while the end product was functional, I was personally not ready to finish my work. This repository is for my own updates to the app. You can view the original site deployed here => (https://team-b-plant-it-app.herokuapp.com/) and the source code here => (https://github.com/ccmalcom/GardenProject-NewClient.git)

### Features
PlantIt features a fully functional backend server that was built using PostgreSQL and Node.js. Tables feature full CRUD functionality and is also deployed via heroku. 

The client was built using React.js framework and heavily uses hooks such as useState and useEffect
